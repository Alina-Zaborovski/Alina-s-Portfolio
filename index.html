        Hello, my name is Alina. Welcome to my site!<br>
         Here, you'll find a portfolio of the projects I've worked on and created throughout my career as a technical writer.<br>

        <h2 class="card-title">Operator Manual</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
            This chapter, which is part of a larger maintenance manual authored in Madcap Flare, was created through research and collaboration 
            with the software engineers at Elbit.</br>
        </br>
            It introduces the maintenance crew, who have a basic familiarity with the software, to its maintenance capabilities.</br>
            The chapter features technical descriptions I distilled from the research, along with screenshots provided by the engineering team for added clarity. </br>

            This is a Word Macro document I developed to introduce new writers on our team to the company’s writing style, style guide and standards.</br>
